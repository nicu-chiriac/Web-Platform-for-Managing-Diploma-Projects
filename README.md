# Web Application made with PERN Stack

## React Frontend and Express.js REST API Backend.

The platform is made to help the process of the administration of bachelorâ€™s degree final projects inside the University Department and can do the following : 
  - keep track of students data 
  - keep track of professors data, their availability/current number of students that they coordinate
  - bachelor's degree research topics/projects
  - establishing the relation between students and their coordinating professors
  - user, super-user and admin privileges
  - every student has an own page where files can be uploaded (txt, pdf, img etc.)
  - Admin can delete, add, update and validate students status in order for them to participate in the final exam
  - admin page where all users can be seen, be given privileges or delete.
  
WEB based application with a client-server arhitecture and using a relational database.
